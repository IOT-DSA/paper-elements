# Paper elements

**Note:** This package is for polymer.dart < 0.17

This package wraps the Polymer project's paper elements, enabling Dart
developers to easily use the Polymer implementation of Google's material
design UI widgets.

You can find out more about paper elements here:
http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/material.html

The paper_elements package bundles all the paper elements into a single pub
package, so that you can add `paper_elements` as a dependency in your pubspec.
Installing npm and bower is not required.
   

## Status

This is an early access version of the paper elements. The elements are still
changing on both the JavaScript and Dart sides.


## Using elements

All elements live at the top level of the `lib/` folder.

Import into HTML:

    <link rel="import" href="packages/paper_elements/paper_input.html">

Import into Dart:

    import 'package:paper_elements/paper_input.dart';
 

## Examples

All examples are located in a separate repo,
https://github.com/dart-lang/polymer-core-and-paper-examples.
